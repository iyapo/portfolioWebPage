      <!-- Introduction -->
      <section>
        <h2 id="#intro">Hello,</h2>
        <p>My name is Iyapo Jones and I live in Westminster, Maryland.</p>
        <p>I want to become a developer to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Solve  problems and improve processes.</li>
          <li>Make people's lives easier.</li>
          <li>learn more about AI and machine-learning.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please take a look at my website and feel free to <a href="#contact">Contact Me!</a></p>

        <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>

        <p>Since I was a little guy, I wanted to be a Pen Tester and I have a knack for coding. I developed an interest in websites back when Myspace was prominent and when you put all of those things together you get Web Development. Becoming a Full Stack Developer is a step along my journey and I can't wait to learn more.</p>
	      
	<p>I look at every interaction as a chance to learn something. I am excited to see what I can learn from my fellow students at Thinkful, and I look forward to the projects we will create together.</p>

        <p>I model and act part-time so being able to make my own website  will definitely be beneficial as I continue those hobbies. I love video games and mobile applications and I can't wait to use the skills I learn in the near future to create content in those domains as well.</p>
